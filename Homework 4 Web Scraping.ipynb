      "We will discuss the form, aesthetics, and politics of individual films and we will examine larger efforts by artists and activists to build a Black women’s film culture, asking such questions as: What does a film history of Black feminism look like, and what scholarly and creative methods does such a history demand? \n",
      "To begin to answer these questions, we will revisit the 1976 Sojourner Truth Festival of the Arts—believed to be the first ever Black women’s film festival—organized by Michele Wallace, Faith Ringgold, Patricia Jones, Margo Jefferson, and Monica Freeman. The class will collectively participate in a homage series inspired by the 1976 festival, featuring work by filmmakers from the original festival such as Monica Freeman, Madeline Anderson, Michelle Parkerson, Ayoka Chenzira, Carol Munday Lawrence, Edie Lynch, and Camille Billops; as well as others including Julie Dash, Zeinabu irene Davis, Maya Angelou, and Yvonne Welbon. The weekly course screenings will be open to the public and students will gain experience in the public presentation of films by actively engaging in public-facing aspects of film exhibition (writing program notes, delivering introductions, participating in discussions, etc.). The class will culminate with a two-day symposium that will bring together around 35 Black feminist filmmakers and artists, including a number from the 1976 festival, to revisit the threads and legacies of the original event and discuss the present and future of Black women’s film practices.<br/>\n",

      "Note(s): Advanced Seminar: U.S. Independent Cinema, 1958–1994\n",
      "The public’s conception of “indie films” in the U.S. has historically been dominated by a select few boutique distributors (Miramax in the 1990s, Focus in the 2000s, A24 in the 2010s) with outsized influence in defining the scope and boundaries of the category. This course examines several decades in which the category of independent cinema was more adventurous and contentious. From 1958–1994, the dream of a New American Cinema was born and quickly died, and in its place emerged a landscape in which exploitation hucksters, avant-garde experimenters, and oppositional political filmmakers vied for eyes and dollars. From Shirley Clarke’s Film-maker’s Distribution Center to Roger Corman’s American International Pictures, from Melvin Van Peebles’ Blaxploitation milestones to the L.A. Rebellion, from New Narrative to New Queer Cinema, this class examines the many strange bedfellows that co-existed in the independent space prior to the stylistic ossification that occurred as “indie” became a big business and a marketing label. As we grapple with this historical moment, students will familiarize themselves with writings by contemporary filmmakers and critics, and work through critical categories by applying them to case studies. Along the way, they will amass the historical knowledge and analytical toolset required to complete a final paper built around a well-supported argument.<br/>\n",

They will relate to the physics principle introduced that Monday and explore its ramification within the broader context of contemporary architectural practice. The Thursday afternoon workshop component will involve team-based, hands-on construction projects to develop a better understanding and intuition of the physics principles introduced in the lectures and to obtain a sense of their real-life implications. The workshops will also provide an opportunity to interact with the guest lecturers. Attendance at Thursday lectures is required.

      "We will discuss the form, aesthetics, and politics of individual films and we will examine larger efforts by artists and activists to build a Black women’s film culture, asking such questions as: What does a film history of Black feminism look like, and what scholarly and creative methods does such a history demand? \n",
      "To begin to answer these questions, we will revisit the 1976 Sojourner Truth Festival of the Arts—believed to be the first ever Black women’s film festival—organized by Michele Wallace, Faith Ringgold, Patricia Jones, Margo Jefferson, and Monica Freeman. The class will collectively participate in a homage series inspired by the 1976 festival, featuring work by filmmakers from the original festival such as Monica Freeman, Madeline Anderson, Michelle Parkerson, Ayoka Chenzira, Carol Munday Lawrence, Edie Lynch, and Camille Billops; as well as others including Julie Dash, Zeinabu irene Davis, Maya Angelou, and Yvonne Welbon. The weekly course screenings will be open to the public and students will gain experience in the public presentation of films by actively engaging in public-facing aspects of film exhibition (writing program notes, delivering introductions, participating in discussions, etc.). The class will culminate with a two-day symposium that will bring together around 35 Black feminist filmmakers and artists, including a number from the 1976 festival, to revisit the threads and legacies of the original event and discuss the present and future of Black women’s film practices.<br/>\n",

      "Note(s): Advanced Seminar: U.S. Independent Cinema, 1958–1994\n",
      "The public’s conception of “indie films” in the U.S. has historically been dominated by a select few boutique distributors (Miramax in the 1990s, Focus in the 2000s, A24 in the 2010s) with outsized influence in defining the scope and boundaries of the category. This course examines several decades in which the category of independent cinema was more adventurous and contentious. From 1958–1994, the dream of a New American Cinema was born and quickly died, and in its place emerged a landscape in which exploitation hucksters, avant-garde experimenters, and oppositional political filmmakers vied for eyes and dollars. From Shirley Clarke’s Film-maker’s Distribution Center to Roger Corman’s American International Pictures, from Melvin Van Peebles’ Blaxploitation milestones to the L.A. Rebellion, from New Narrative to New Queer Cinema, this class examines the many strange bedfellows that co-existed in the independent space prior to the stylistic ossification that occurred as “indie” became a big business and a marketing label. As we grapple with this historical moment, students will familiarize themselves with writings by contemporary filmmakers and critics, and work through critical categories by applying them to case studies. Along the way, they will amass the historical knowledge and analytical toolset required to complete a final paper built around a well-supported argument.<br/>\n",

In addition to the joy of enlarging the conversation of literature by bringing new voices into another language, the practice of literary translation forces us as writers to examine the materials and tools of our craft. In this workshop, we will critique each other’s translations of prose, poetry, or drama into English, as well as explore various creative strategies and approaches to translation by a variety of practitioners that touch on various aspects of the \"radical recontextualization\" that constitute the decision-making work of literary translation. Through these processes, you will formulate your own strategies to both literary translation and creative writing. We will also have the opportunity to have conversations via Zoom with some of the translators we’ll be reading. Students should have at least an intermediate proficiency in a foreign language to take this workshop.<br/>\n",

      "To begin to answer these questions, we will revisit the 1976 Sojourner Truth Festival of the Arts—believed to be the first ever Black women’s film festival—organized by Michele Wallace, Faith Ringgold, Patricia Jones, Margo Jefferson, and Monica Freeman. The class will collectively participate in a homage series inspired by the 1976 festival, featuring work by filmmakers from the original festival such as Monica Freeman, Madeline Anderson, Michelle Parkerson, Ayoka Chenzira, Carol Munday Lawrence, Edie Lynch, and Camille Billops; as well as others including Julie Dash, Zeinabu irene Davis, Maya Angelou, and Yvonne Welbon. The weekly course screenings will be open to the public and students will gain experience in the public presentation of films by actively engaging in public-facing aspects of film exhibition (writing program notes, delivering introductions, participating in discussions, etc.). The class will culminate with a two-day symposium that will bring together around 35 Black feminist filmmakers and artists, including a number from the 1976 festival, to revisit the threads and legacies of the original event and discuss the present and future of Black women’s film practices.<br/>\n",

      "We will discuss the form, aesthetics, and politics of individual films and we will examine larger efforts by artists and activists to build a Black women’s film culture, asking such questions as: What does a film history of Black feminism look like, and what scholarly and creative methods does such a history demand? \n",
      "To begin to answer these questions, we will revisit the 1976 Sojourner Truth Festival of the Arts—believed to be the first ever Black women’s film festival—organized by Michele Wallace, Faith Ringgold, Patricia Jones, Margo Jefferson, and Monica Freeman. The class will collectively participate in a homage series inspired by the 1976 festival, featuring work by filmmakers from the original festival such as Monica Freeman, Madeline Anderson, Michelle Parkerson, Ayoka Chenzira, Carol Munday Lawrence, Edie Lynch, and Camille Billops; as well as others including Julie Dash, Zeinabu irene Davis, Maya Angelou, and Yvonne Welbon. The weekly course screenings will be open to the public and students will gain experience in the public presentation of films by actively engaging in public-facing aspects of film exhibition (writing program notes, delivering introductions, participating in discussions, etc.). The class will culminate with a two-day symposium that will bring together around 35 Black feminist filmmakers and artists, including a number from the 1976 festival, to revisit the threads and legacies of the original event and discuss the present and future of Black women’s film practices.<br/>\n",

      "To begin to answer these questions, we will revisit the 1976 Sojourner Truth Festival of the Arts—believed to be the first ever Black women’s film festival—organized by Michele Wallace, Faith Ringgold, Patricia Jones, Margo Jefferson, and Monica Freeman. The class will collectively participate in a homage series inspired by the 1976 festival, featuring work by filmmakers from the original festival such as Monica Freeman, Madeline Anderson, Michelle Parkerson, Ayoka Chenzira, Carol Munday Lawrence, Edie Lynch, and Camille Billops; as well as others including Julie Dash, Zeinabu irene Davis, Maya Angelou, and Yvonne Welbon. The weekly course screenings will be open to the public and students will gain experience in the public presentation of films by actively engaging in public-facing aspects of film exhibition (writing program notes, delivering introductions, participating in discussions, etc.). The class will culminate with a two-day symposium that will bring together around 35 Black feminist filmmakers and artists, including a number from the 1976 festival, to revisit the threads and legacies of the original event and discuss the present and future of Black women’s film practices.<br/>\n",

      "Note(s): Beginning Translation Workshop: It’s been said that in an ideal world, all writers would be translators, and all translators would be writers. In addition to the joy of enlarging the conversation of literature by bringing new voices into another language, the practice of literary translation forces us as writers to examine the materials and tools of our craft. In this workshop, we will critique each other’s translations of prose, poetry, or drama into English, as well as explore various creative strategies and approaches to translation by a variety of practitioners that touch on various aspects of the \"radical recontextualization\" that constitute the decision-making work of literary translation. Through these processes, you will formulate your own strategies to both literary translation and creative writing. We will also have the opportunity to have conversations via Zoom with some of the translators we’ll be reading. Students should have at least an intermediate proficiency in a foreign language to take this workshop.<br/>\n",
